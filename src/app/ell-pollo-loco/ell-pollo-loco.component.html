        Developed using an object-oriented approach, the "Jump, Run, and Throw" game follows a meticulously crafted design. In
        this captivating gaming experience, players assist Pepe in his quest to collect coins while strategically acquiring
        tabasco salsa to counter the antics of the frenzied hen. The implementation highlights my adept programming skills, as I
        seamlessly integrate interactive elements, character behaviors, and power-up dynamics, resulting in an immersive and
        engaging gameplay environment.
